A web-extension for customizing website favicons.

Differences from muffinresearch

Matching on urls is now done by regex

Removed matching on title of page

Multiple rules can match a page (in order from top to bottom)

You can set a prefix for the title of the page.

In otherwords, this facilitates my workflow of having many
similar looking pages open in various environments. (local, testing, prod, etc).
I use it by having the favicon be a different color and prepending [test] or [prod].
You get the idea. Also vertical tabs, because otherwise this would be useless.
